## ➕ Future Improvements

While the current version of the site meets the project requirements, here are some improvements I’d consider making in future iterations:

- 🔄 **Add a backend or database** to store orders and contact form submissions  
- 🧾 **Implement a working checkout system** with payment processing (e.g. Stripe API)  
- 🎨 **Allow users to customize orders** (e.g. add milk types, toppings, sizes)  
- 🧠 **Use toast notifications** instead of browser alerts for a smoother user experience  
- 🌍 **Improve accessibility further** with skip links and more screen reader enhancements  
- 📱 **Enhance mobile layout** with smoother animations and off-canvas cart panel  
- 🧪 **Set up unit tests** for cart functionality and form validation using testing frameworks
